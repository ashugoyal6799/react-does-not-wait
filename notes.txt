1. Why do we use 'type=module' ? 
-> To tell browser that the script is a module (so that we can use import, export and other things to make code modular and better)

2. Suppose there are two childers componets under a parent component (for class based component , for function components you can replace ComponentDidMount with useEffect)
[assuming no async call is being made across everywhere in these components]
logs order:

Parent Constructor
Parent render
    First Child Constructor
    First Child Render
    Second Child Constructor
    Second Child Constructor
    
    ----DOM UPDATED FOR CHILDREN-----

    First Child ComponentDidMount
    Second Child componentDidMount
Parent ComponentDidMount



3. Why does we can make the `componentDidMount` function as `async` [In class based componentes] but not the make the `useEffect` function as `async` [in Functional Components] ?
